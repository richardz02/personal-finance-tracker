# Personal Finance Tracker
This is a simple personal finance tracker to track your daily income/expenses. 

## How it's made
**Tech used**: Java, Spring Boot
So far this project is only consisted of Java and the Spring Boot framework (I'm learning about implementing backend using Spring Boot). In the future I will consider adding a frontend using React. 

## Optimizations
Since this is still the beginning stages of this project, currently, I am using an ArrayList to store all the transactions users enter, in memory. I will move onto storing the content using a json file next. For the final product, all transactions will be stored in a database. 

## Lessons Learned
- I've learned about the Java Spring Boot's MVC (model, view, controller) structure.
